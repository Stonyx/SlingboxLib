Slingbox Library Readme

SlingboxLib is a full featured cross platform C++ library that allows communication with all the
various Slingbox devices made by Sling Media.  It has been compiled and tested under Ubuntu 10.04,
FreeBSD 8.0, Mac OS X 10.5 for Power PC, Mac OS X 10.6 for Intel, 1st and 2nd Generation Apple TV,
and Windows XP, Vista, and 7.

Currently all Slingboxes encrypt their streams when resolution above 320x240 are selected.  Some
Slingboxes, like the Slingbox Pro HD, encrypt all their streams, regardless of the selected
resolution.
